		<h3>Our story</h3>
		<br />
		<h4>
			Polymyr was founded based on our experiences as tech gadget enthusiasts. We saw the consumer hardware market grow at an exponential rate; however, great teams building these great products had no effective channel to gather quality user feedback at scale. We identified that existing methods such as surveys could only go so far when their final destination is people’s inboxes. 
		</h4>
		<br />
		<h4>
			At Polymyr, we’ve set out on a journey to create a marketplace where feedback is part of the purchasing experience. We see our community as not just consumers, but also true backers of the teams behind the products we curate.
